# Iris-Data-Set-Classification
Look at the most popular Iris Dataset and use various classifiers to predict the classes based on the features

**Overview:**
- Look at distribution of features, and use pairplot to visualize the relation between them
- Split the data into train and test datasets
- Train using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Support Vector Machines
- Look at metrics like accuracy score, f1 score, and plot confusion matrix

**Conclusion:**\
It's possible to predict Setosa accurately (100%), as it is linearly separable from other classes. The overall accuracy was greater than 95% and it did not depend on what classifier we used for prediction. It is also to be noted that the there were only 150 data points available, of which only 45 points (30%) was used for testing purposes.
